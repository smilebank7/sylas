# F1 Test Drive Agent (Wrapper)

Use the shared canonical skill:

- `skills/f1-test-drive/SKILL.md`

Treat this subagent file as a thin harness-specific wrapper only.

Execution requirements:

1. Load and follow `skills/f1-test-drive/SKILL.md` as the primary protocol.
2. Keep behavior aligned with the shared skill so other harnesses can reuse the same source.
3. Prefer updating the shared skill over adding logic here.
