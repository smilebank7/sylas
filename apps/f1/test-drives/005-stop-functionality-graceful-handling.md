# Test Drive 005: Stop Functionality Graceful Handling

**Date:** 2025-12-20
**Issue:** [CYPACK-648](https://linear.app/ceedar/issue/CYPACK-648/clean-up-this-lack-of-error-handling-for-the-normal-case-of-user)
**Purpose:** Verify that user-initiated stop commands are handled gracefully without error stack traces

## Background

When a user stops a Claude session via the 'stop' command in Linear, the system was previously logging full error stack traces for `AbortError`, which was noisy and misleading since stopping is a normal operation.

### Before Fix (Expected Behavior to Avoid)
```
[ClaudeRunner] Session error: AbortError: Claude Code process aborted by user
    at ChildProcess.<anonymous> (...)
    at ChildProcess.emit (node:events:518:28)
    ... (full stack trace)
Unhandled claude error: AbortError: Claude Code process aborted by user
    at ChildProcess.<anonymous> (...)
    ... (full stack trace)
```

### After Fix (Expected Behavior)
```
[ClaudeRunner] Session stopped by user
```

## Test Setup

1. **F1 Server Configuration:**
   - Port: 3650
   - Repository: `/Users/agentops/.sylas/worktrees/CYPACK-648`
   - Platform: CLI mode

2. **Test Issue:**
   - ID: `issue-1` (DEF-1)
   - Title: "Test stop functionality for CYPACK-648"

## Test Execution

### Step 1: Start F1 Server
```bash
cd apps/f1
SYLAS_PORT=3650 SYLAS_REPO_PATH=/Users/agentops/.sylas/worktrees/CYPACK-648 pnpm run server
```

### Step 2: Create Test Issue
```bash
SYLAS_PORT=3650 ./f1 create-issue \
  --title "Test stop functionality for CYPACK-648" \
  --description "This is a test issue to verify that stopping a Claude session logs correctly without error stack traces."
```
**Result:** Issue created successfully with ID `issue-1`

### Step 3: Start Agent Session
```bash
SYLAS_PORT=3650 ./f1 start-session --issue-id issue-1
```
**Result:** Session `session-1` started successfully

### Step 4: Wait for Session Activity
Waited ~10 seconds for session to start processing. Verified 6 activities were created.

### Step 5: Stop Session
```bash
SYLAS_PORT=3650 ./f1 stop-session --session-id session-1
```
**Result:** Session stopped successfully

## Observations

### Server Log Output (Relevant Lines)
```
[EdgeWorker] Received stop signal for agent activity session session-1
[ClaudeRunner] Stopping Claude session
[EdgeWorker] Stopped agent session for agent activity session session-1
[AgentSessionManager] Created response activity for session session-1
[ClaudeRunner] Session stopped by user
[EdgeWorker] Streaming session started: cf461403-f4eb-4bfe-99ca-58e50a4838e3
```

### Key Findings

1. **Fix Verified:** The log now shows `[ClaudeRunner] Session stopped by user` at info level instead of an error with full stack trace.

2. **No Error Stack Traces:** The `AbortError` is no longer logged as an error. No stack traces appear in the output.

3. **No "Unhandled claude error" Message:** The EdgeWorker's `handleClaudeError` method correctly silences the AbortError.

4. **Clean Shutdown Flow:**
   - EdgeWorker receives stop signal
   - ClaudeRunner stops the session
   - EdgeWorker confirms session stopped
   - AgentSessionManager creates response activity
   - ClaudeRunner logs graceful stop message

## Test Result

**PASS** - The fix correctly handles user-initiated stops gracefully without error logging.

## Files Modified in Fix

- `packages/claude-runner/src/ClaudeRunner.ts` - Added name-based AbortError detection, moved console.error to only log actual errors
- `packages/edge-worker/src/EdgeWorker.ts` - Updated handleClaudeError to use name-based detection, added SIGTERM handling
